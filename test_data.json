The youngest of the seven children of Francis Thomas Marshall and his wife Ellen Maria, she maintained a close bond with her siblings and their families throughout her life. The household in which she grew up was a somewhat unconventional one: her father, a removal-man, died just before her seventh birthday, and shortly afterwards her mother Ellen began a relationship with a man some 20 years her junior, Louis Slade, with whom in 1892 she went on to have one further child. Ellen and Louis finally married in 1905, four years before Ellen\u2019s death. Most of Louisa\u2019s siblings lived their adult lives in south London. Throughout her life she remained particularly close to her eldest sister Mrs Rhoda Matilda Newbon, who was mother to 13 children.\n\nSadie took to the stage in London in her mid teens, and it is clear that early on she developed a taste for black popular culture, and music in particular. She would marry twice; both her husbands were black Americans. Numerous photographs suggest that she went out of her way to present herself as a 'black', 'coloured' or 'creole' woman, presumably feeling this would give her greater appeal as a performer, and several newspaper articles also suggest that her origins were more exotic than they really were. Throughout her career she seems to have used professionally the forename Sadie, although the origins of this stage name are not known.\n\nVarious sources allow us to piece together Sadie\u2019s career. Not least among these is a short account of her life that she herself wrote in 1960 in her mid 70s. From this we learn that she left school at 11 (working initially as a domestic servant) and within a few years was employed as a dancer at London\u2019s Empire Theatre. Her first big break came with an invitation from the American entertainer Laura Hampton (n\u00e9e Bowman) to join her review troupe, following which she was signed up for a European tour of the show 'A Trip to Coontown'. \nSadie met her first husband, saxophonist Adolph Crawford, in 1906 and was soon working with him as a vaudeville music hall double act, although at this time she was using the name Sadie Johnson. In the years leading up to the First World War the duo can be found performing in Russia, Bucharest, the Balkan States and Scandinavia, as well as Berlin and Paris, and in the war years all corners of the United Kingdom.\n\nSadie and Adolph finally married in Southwark in June 1918, just as the jazz craze was sweeping across Europe. Their international careers started to take off in earnest at this time, with invitations to tour the world pouring in. In the post-war years they can be found as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, in addition to Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Paris, very much the European capital of jazz with so many resident and ad hoc bands and orchestras, became an important base for the duo.\n\nIt was in Paris in the early 1920s that the few recordings to feature them (as part of Gordon Stretton\u2019s \u2018Orchestre Syncopated Six\u2019) were made by Path\u00e9; it was also at the American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, that Adolph Crawford died in 1929.\n\nWithin a few months of Adolph's death Sadie sailed to New York City with Lew Leslie's \u2018Blackbirds\u2019 and it was in the United States that she thereafter settled. After suffering a nervous breakdown she was advised to go to Saratoga Springs to recuperate and it was there she met her second husband Frank Mozee (a chauffeur, some 16 years younger than she was), whom she married in 1930, when she would have been 44. Sadie and Frank made their home in Washington D.C. and it seems that her second marriage effectively marked the end of her stage career. From America she regularly visited her family back in Tooting (in the early years by boat but latterly by plane), staying at the Regent Palace Hotel in central London. Although she had no children of her own, Sadie was \u2018foster mother\u2019 to a daughter, Lillian Brown.\nSadie Mozee died at Washington\u2019s District of Columbia General Hospital on 18 December 1965, a few days short of her 80th birthday, the Washington \"Evening Star\" revealing in her obituary notice that her death occurred \u2018after a long illness\u2019. The article also states that she was a member of St Martin\u2019s Catholic Church and that she is buried in Washington's Mount Olivet Cemetery.

However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery.\n\nDuring the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments.

Smalley\n\nWilliam Allen Smalley (April 4, 1923December 16, 1997) was an American linguist. He is best known for his role in the development of the Romanized Popular Alphabet for the Hmong language.\n\nWilliam A. Smalley was born in 1923 in Jerusalem, where his parents worked as missionaries of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. He and his family remained there until 1934, at which time they returned to the United States.\n\nIn 1941, he matriculated in Houghton College, where he developed an interest in anthropology, which he saw as relevant to missionary work. After graduating from Houghton in 1945 with a degree in English literature, he attended the Missionary Training Institute (1945\u201346) and received linguistic training in Bible translation at the Summer Institute of Linguistics at the University of Oklahoma (1946, 1947). In 1946, he also enrolled in Columbia University's graduate program in anthropology with an emphasis on linguistics.\n\nIn 1950, the Christian and Missionary Alliance sent him to the southern region of Vietnam, where he worked on problems of language analysis. The following year, he was sent to Luang Prabang in Laos in order to analyse Khmu and prepare lessons in the language for other missionaries.\n\nIn Laos, he met Reverend G. Linwood Barney and Father Yves Bertrais, and together they began working on a writing system for the Hmong language, which had until then been unwritten. The system they developed became known as the Romanized Popular Alphabet, and it is today the most widely used Hmong writing system. Yang Dao, the assistant director of the English Language Learner Project of the St. Paul Public Schools, has said: \"I cannot value his work. \u2026 It is invaluable. This writing system helped us to preserve our culture and tradition and history. Now it is used by Hmong all over the world.\"\n\nIn 1954, the outbreak of the Laotian Civil War forced him and his wife to return to the United States. There he completed his dissertation on the Khmu language, for which he was awarded a doctorate by Columbia in 1956. (In 1961, an abbreviated version of his dissertation was published by the American Oriental Society.)\n\nFrom 1954 onwards, he worked primarily in Southeast Asia as a translation consultant and coordinator for the American Bible Society and its parent organization, United Bible Societies. The nature of his work meant that he twice took up residence in Thailand, first from 1962 to 1967 and then again from 1969 to 1972.\n\nHe was the editor of \"Practical Anthropology\" (now known as \"Missiology\") from 1955 to 1968 and an associate editor of \"The Bible Translator\" from 1957 to 1959.\n\nIn 1977, after twenty-three years with the American Bible Society and United Bible Societies, he decided to leave. Unable to find employment, he worked for a time at a discount toy store.\n\nIn 1978, he relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota, to accept a position as Professor of Linguistics at Bethel University. To his surprise, he discovered that many thousands of Hmong refugees were also settling in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area.\n\nAs an Honorary Fellow with the University of Minnesota Southeast Asia Refugee Studies Program, he took part in a project studying Hmong adaptation to life in the United States, publishing 'Adaptive Language Strategies of the Hmong: From Asian Mountains to American Ghettos' (1985) and 'Stages of Hmong Cultural Adaptation' (1986).\n\nHe also studied the different Hmong scripts that had been developed after the Romanized Popular Alphabet, in particular the Pahawh Hmong script, which was created in Laos in 1959 by Shong Lue Yang. With Chia Koua Vang and Gnia Yee Yang, he wrote two books about Pahawh Hmong and its creator: \"Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script\" and \"The Life of Shong Lue Yang: Hmong \u201cMother of Writing\u201d\" (both published in 1990).\n\nFrom 1983 to 1992, he was an associate editor of \"Language Sciences\".\n\nIn 1985 and 1986, he once again lived in Thailand, this time as a Fulbright research fellow researching the different languages and dialects of the country. His book \"Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand\" (1994) has been described by the Thai scholar David Smyth as \"a masterful study of the relationship between the national language, regional dialects and minority languages\".\n\nHe retired from Bethel University in 1987, but continued to write extensively in his retirement.\n\nHe died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-four.", "id": 31}, {"title": "John_O_Keefe__politician_", "content": "John O'Keefe (politician)\n\nJohn O'Keefe (1827 - 10 June 1877) was an Irish Home Rule League politician. \n\nHe sat as Home Rule MP for Dungarvan in 1874 until his death at age 49 in 1877.", "id": 32}, {"title": "Memphis_Bound", "content": "Memphis Bound\n\nMemphis Bound (usually styled Memphis Bound!) is a 1945 American musical based on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera \"H.M.S. Pinafore\". The score was adapted and augmented by Don Walker and Clay Warnick, with a libretto credited to Albert Barker and Sally Benson, \"with gratitude to W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan.\" The original production starred an all-black cast including Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse.\n\nAn all-African-American touring company is traveling to Memphis on a showboat, the \"Calliboga Queen\". When the boat is run aground in Tennessee, the company mounts a production of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" to raise funds to get it unstuck. Much of the musical consists of a play within a play, as the company presents a musically updated version of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera; the boat pilot (played by Bill Robinson in the original production) takes a major role as Sir Joseph Porter, First Lord of the Admiralty. Another actor (Avon Long in the original) sings and dances the role of Captain Corcoran, while the part of Josephine goes to an Andrews Sisters-style trio of women from the company chorus (Sheila Guyse, Ida James, and Thelma Carpenter)\u2014each had been promised the role, so they join forces and play it simultaneously. The police arrest the company for performing without a license, and the case is taken to court in a scene involving excerpts from another Gilbert and Sullivan work, \"Trial by Jury\".\n\nIn 1939, Robinson had starred as the Lord High Executioner in Mike Todd's musical \"The Hot Mikado\", based on Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Mikado\" (another updated version, \"The Swing Mikado\", opened on Broadway almost simultaneously). \"Memphis Bound\" marked his return to Broadway, in another vehicle based on Gilbert and Sullivan. John Wildberg, who had successfully presented Philip Yordan's \"Anna Lucasta\" with an African-American cast on Broadway the previous year, was producer; Robert Ross directed, assisted by Eva Jessye, with Vinton Freedley credited for \"personal supervision\" of the show. \"Memphis\", one of numerous Second World War-era Broadway musicals created by white production teams for black casts, was the last such show to appear during the war.\n\nMost of the score was derived from the Gilbert and Sullivan original; the vocal arrangements and updated lyrics were by Clay Warnick, while the orchestrations and score were adapted by Don Walker. The show also included four original songs by Warnick and Walker\u2014\"Big Old River,\" \"Stand Around the Bend,\" \"Old Love and Brand New Love,\" and \"Growing Pains\"\u2014written in a pastiche of existing styles. (In the show billing, Walker was credited with the new music, and Warnick and Walker shared credit for the new lyrics.) \"Growing Pains,\" an original duet for Robinson and 8-year-old actor Timothy Grace, was strongly flavored by a Duke Ellington sound, while the Gilbert and Sullivan material was arranged as swing music with a boogie-woogie edge. \n\nRobinson interpolated his specialty, a dance on stairs, as a high point of the show. Avon Long, known for playing Sportin' Life in the 1942 Broadway production of \"Porgy and Bess\", provided additional solo dancing, using a full-body movement style contrasting with Robinson's foot-based work.\n\nThe show opened at the Broadway Theatre on May 24, 1945. John Chapman of the \"New York Daily News\" gave the show a rave review, saying \"It has been too many years since I have seen a musical with the zip, the stomp, and the whoosh of \"Memphis Bound\". \u2026 It's good-naured as a puppy, and frequently very smart.\" Wilella Waldorf of the \"New York Post\" was more critical of the book, commenting that though the adaptation of \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" was \"interesting musically and often very funny,\" the show as a whole was inconsistent, with \"no uniform pattern \u2026 set for the travesty.\" \"Life\" magazine's anonymous critic highlighted the contributions of Robinson and \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", noting with amusement that both were 67 years old, but added that when neither were featured onstage, \"the show gets very dreary.\" Bob Francis of \"Billboard\" magazine similarly praised the \"Pinafore\" segments and the stars over the original elements of the book, commenting: \"If two actors could put \"Memphis\" over for a smash, it should be Robinson and Long. Unfortunately, the task is too heavy for a two-man job.\" Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing.\n\nDuring its run, \"Memphis\" moved from the Broadway to the Belasco Theatre. It closed on June 23, 1945, after 36 performances, losing money on its original investment. The show was hampered in part due to competition from \"Hollywood Pinafore\", a George S. Kaufman musical comedy drawing on exactly the same Gilbert and Sullivan material. However, Kaufman's version, which opened exactly a week after \"Memphis\", was a much more pronounced critical failure.\n\n\"The Nightingale, The Moon and I,\" one of the numbers closely based on a Gilbert and Sullivan original, was recorded in the 1990s for the compilation album \"Life's a Funny Present\".", "id": 33}, {"title": "Belinda_Davis", "content": "Belinda Davis\n\nBelinda Joy Davis (born July 13, 1959) is an American historian of modern Germany and Europe.

The citadel was built on Petersberg hill, in the north-western part of the old town centre from 1665, when Erfurt was governed by the Electorate of Mainz. It is surrounded by over two kilometres of stone walls and is 36 hectares in size.\n\nErfurt has also been ruled by Sweden, Prussia, Napoleon, the German Empire, the Nazis, and post-World War II Soviet occupying forces, and it was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). All of these regimes used Petersberg Citadel and had an influence on its development. The baroque fortress was in military use until 1963. Since German reunification in 1990, the citadel has undergone significant restoration and it is now open to the public as an historic site. Its maze of underground passageways are also open to vistors and the fortress bakery (1832) is again in working order.\n\nThe fortress is also known by its French name, \"Citadelle Petersberg\", as French troops were stationed there from 1806 to 1814, when Erfurt was under Napoleonic occupation. Napoleon visited Erfurt several times and the citadel was further developed during his rule, although parts of it were damaged in a battle in 1813.\n\nThe citadel was built on the site of a medieval Benedictine Monastery and the earliest parts of the complex date from the 12th century.\n\nThe former lower barracks (German:\"Untere Kaserne\") building is now used to house and administer archives of the Stasi, the Ministry for State Security of the former German Democratic Republic.\n\nThe , is a smaller fortress to the south-west of Erfurt city centre, which dates from 1480. It is now the home of the German Horticulture Museum. During the Napoleonic period a hidden trench connecting the two citadels was built. The remains of this connection can still be seen at the Cyriaksburg Citadel today.\n\nPetersberg Citadel is entwined with the history of Erfurt. The city was first mentioned in 742 in a letter from St Boniface to Pope Zachary, when the Catholic Diocese of Erfurt was established. It was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and was brought into the Diocese of Mainz in 755. The earliest archaeological find from the middle ages on Petersberg\nhill is a coin dating from c.850, from the time of Lothair I, Holy Roman Emperor from 817 to 855. It was found in a grave, in the mouth of the deceased.\n\nThe oldest surviving building in the citadel is the Peterskirche (St. Peters Church), which was part of the Benedictine\nMonastery of St Peter and Paul, after which the hill, and subsequently the citadel, was named. The first recorded evidence of the monastery is from 1060,\nbut it may have existed a considerable time before that.The original buidling was burnt down in 1080, but was rebuilt from 1103 to 1147 and St Peter's Church is from this second period.\n\nThe city gradually grew more independent during the 12th century, and in 1217 it became fully independent with the founding of its own city council. From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries. About 1625 the city council had the city wall at the Petersberg strenghtened by building a large hornwork and two bastions. These are the bastions named Gabriel and Michael. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Erfurt was occupied by Swedish forces from 1631. The Swedish king, Gustav II Adolf, hoped to build a fortress on Petersberg hill, but he died in 1632 and the plans never came to fruition. However, the Swedes did strengthen the existing Bastion Gabriel in 1643. In 1664 the city and the surrounding area were conquered by the Electorate of Mainz. On 1 June 1665 the foundation stone of Petersberg Citadel was laid.\n\nThe formal first construction phase lasted from 1665-1707, following an order from Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn (1605-1673), Archbishop-Elector of Mainz and Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg and Worms, to build the citadel. Von Sch\u00f6nborn had recently conquered Erfurt and wanted to build the fortress to demonstrate his power to the local population, in order to suppress any ideas of rebellion.\n\nA plan that the Erfurt architect (c.1660-1663) had created for the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf served as a basic model for the citadel, and the work was substantially influenced by (c.1620-1701) the architect to the imperial court of Mainz.\nThis included the building of the walls, bastions, the ravelins called Anselm and Lotha, the main gateway (\"Peterstor\") and commandant building, three barracks, which are amongs the oldest surviving barracks in Germany, and the tunnels within the walls, called \"Horchg\u00e4nge\" in German, meaning the 'listening passages'.\n\nThe second construction phase was from 1707 to 1728, under the direction of the architect Maximilian von Welsch (1671-1745), who was made an imperial knight with the title \"Edler von Welsch\" for his services to architecture by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in 1714. Welsch put special emphasis on the reinforcement of the fortress and trench defenses.\n\nErfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate Prussia for its territories on the left bank of the Rhine that were lost to France. However, on 16 October 1806 Erfurt was handed over to French forces in what is known as the Capitulation of Erfurt, which followed the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt.\n\nFrench troops were stationed at Erfurt from 1806 to 1814, when Erfurt was under Napoleonic occupation. Napoleon arrived in the city on 23 June 1807, and created the Principality of Erfurt, which he ruled directly himself.\n\nNapoleon visited Erfurt a number of times during the French occupation. He took a particular interest in Petersberg Citadel. He stayed in Erfurt from 27 September to 14 October 1808, when he meet with Tsar Alexander I of Russia for the Congress of Erfurt. The two leaders visited Petersberg Citadel together during the Congress.\n\nHe also went to Erfurt on 15 December 1812 on his return from Russia to France, and from 25\u201328 April 1813. On 21 April 1813 he had ordered that Petersberg Citadel should be strengthened and equiped so that it could support 2000 men under siege for six months. Both French troops and civilian residence of Erfurt were put to\nwork on the project, with over 3000 civilians working on building the ditches that surround the external walls. The work was carried both day and night, used flaming\ntorches to see by. During this time a hidden trench connecting Petersburg and Cyriaksburg citadels was built, the remains of which can still be seen at Cyriaksburg today.\n\nOn 4 November 1813 Prussian, Austrian and Russian forces drew in on Erfurt and sought to get the French to surrender and leave Petersberg Citadel. There was no surrender and fire was opened on the citadel on 6 November, at six o'clock in the morning. A number of buildings caught fire, including the main guardhouse, monastery building, and parts of St. Peter's Church. One hundred and twenty-one houses in the town centre below the citadel were also destroyed.\n\nThe French didn't surrender, but there was an extended truce and at the beginning of January 1814, the city of Erfurt was handed over to the Prussians, although the French troops remained in the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels. When Paris was captured by allied troops in April 1814, the Napoleonic troops still remained in Petersberg citadel. It was not until 5 May 1814 that French Field Marshal Alexandre Dalton surrendered and handed the citadel over peacefully to the Prussians.\n\nWhen the Prussians took back the citadel in 1814, they began a new building phase which lasted until 1868. They wanted to make the fortress \"bomb proof\", and resilent to the strength of the latest weapons. During this period they built the Defence Barracks, the fortress bakery, wells, latrines, and caponiers. A caponier is part of a fortification built in a ditch to provided covered defence to the ditch and/or access to outer parts of the fort.\n\nAfter German Unification in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created German Empire. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today.\n\nIn June 1873 Emperor Wilhelm I gave orders for Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels to be be pull down, but due to lack of funds this was mostly not done. Two Ravelins (Peter and Wilhelm) and the hornwork along the walls were removed. An access road was built and Lunette I was demolished and Lunette II and Ravelin Gabriel were reduced in height. The rubble was used to fill in the ditches.\n\nPrior to World War I there was renewed the interest in the strategic military location of Petersberg Citadel. New buildings, such as workshops, warehouses, barracks and a military detention centre were built between 1912 and 1914.\n\nThe fortress remained an important garrison position until the end of the war in 1918. After World War I, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was a gradual abandonment of military facilities during the Weimar Republic period. Petersberg was used for garden allotments and by the civil police, who had a detention centre, garages, workshops and stores on the site.\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power in 1933, they again brought the citadel into military use. They built gun casemates, and from 1935 divisional army units, reserve army units and the district army recruitment office were based there. \n\nAlso from 1935, the Nazis used parts of the citadel as a prison for the internment of their political enemies, such as communists and trade unionists. They were kept in a police detention centre originally built to accommodate up to 60 prisoners, but at its peak 241 internees were crowded into the facility. Many of the internees were sent directly from Petersberg citadel to concentration camps. Some were murdered by the Nazis at the citadel itself. The Nazis also had a military court at the citadel for dealing with people such as deserters, which could pronounce death sentences on those being tried, and sometimes these people were immediately executed at the citadel. Today there is a memorial to those mistreated by the Nazis at the site. \n\nSome war damage was sustained, including the 12th century Leonhardskirche (St Leonard's Church), which had been converted into an artillery store, being totally destroyed in an air raid.\n\nAt the end of World War II, Erfurt was liberated by American forces in April 1945, and handed over to the Soviet administration on 3 July 1945, as agreed at the Yalta Conference, held in February 1945. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people had been established in the Defense Barracks, and this continued operating under the occupying Soviet administration after the war.\n\nIn 1949 the Soviet Occupied Zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From 1947 Peterberg Citadel was used mainly for civil purposes, with barracks being used by the civil police. From 1956 until 1963 the East German Army (German: \"Nationale Volksarmee\") used the citadel and its barracks, but they then moved to new facilities on the outskirts of the city. After that the main users of site were the police, for storing equipment, and a garden allotment association. The Stasi had warehouses and workshops on the site for their motor pool until 1990. The rest of the citadel was unused and plants were allowed to naturally regrow.\n\nAfter German reunification in 1990, a massive project to restore the citadel was begun. It is the largest such project undertaken by the Erfurt city council and it is funded by the city council and the Thuringian state and German federal governments. Over 300 people were temporarily employed. Most buildings added since 1868 were removed, most earlier buildings, including the 12th century St Peter's Church, were restored or stabilised, ditches were cleared and walls and bastions were repaired, the \"horchg\u00e4nge\" (listening passages) were cleared, and the 1832 wood-fired fortress bakery was brought back into working order. As at January 2018, the restoration is still on-going.\n\nThe citadel is surround by 2,180 metres of stone walls, which were erected in the first building phase, beginning in 1665. They form the star-shaped ground plan of the citadel, made with eight bastions and four ravelins and are between 1.2 and 6 metres thick, and from 8 to 26 metres high. There are small look-out towers built into the walls. There are now only three ravelins as Ravelin Wilhelm was removed in the 19th century.\n\nThere are tunnels within the walls, called the \"Horchg\u00e4nge\" in German, meaning the 'listening passages'. At the time the citadel was first built there were no trenches or moats beyond the wall, so the \"Horchg\u00e4nge\" were constructed so that soldiers could walk through them to listen for anyone trying to tunnel into the fortress.\n\nThe Peterstor, the main entrance to the citadel, was built from 1666-1668. It was designed by Antonio Petrini and bears the coat of arms of Johann Philipp von Sch\u00f6nborn (1605-1673), the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. In 1993 the two wooden portcullis were reconstructed within the double archway entrance. The script above the gateway which reads \"Citadelle Petersberg\", was installed in 1861.\n\nThe Commandant Building was built in 1669 by an Italian construction team. From 1939 to 1945 it was used as a military court by the Nazis. It was restored in 1998 and is now used by Tanztenne Petersberg, a dance school for traditional Thuringian folkdancing.\n\nThe Peterskirche, the 75 metre-long monastery church, was built between 1103 and 1147. It originally had two towers at its east end, which along with the\ntowers of the Erfurt cathedral and the Severikirche, dominated the city skyline. Until the end of the 13th century, Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and German kings often held court in the church. Church synods also took place there. In November 1181 an Imperial Diet was held in the church, presided over by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, known as \"Barbarossa\". There Barbarossa's cousin Henry the Lion submitted to the emperor's authority after several years of opposition, and ceded most of his lands. \n\nDuring the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) Erfurt was occupied from 1631 by the troops of Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. In 1632, the Swedes briefly dissolved the monastery and temporarily converted it into a Protestant monastery in 1633. After the occupation only three monks remained. The church was damaged and the treasures and stores of the monastery were plundered. The damage to the church was repaired in the first and second building phases of citadel, in 1672 and 1727. In 1765 its interior was baroqueized by Italian plasterers.\n\nIn 1803 the monastery was secularised. On 6 November 1813 Prussian troops bombarded the French occupied citadel and much of it caught fire, including the church and monastery buildings. The monastery buildings, other than the church, were later then completely removed by Prussian forces who took possession of citadel in May 1814. From 1820 the remaining church was used as a store for flour and military provisions. The towers were dismantled, a new roof was built and three storage levels were constructed inside. In spite of these alterations, the building still has traces of medieval and baroque architectural details, sculpture and paintwork, and the monumental size of the building can still be appreciated.\n\nSince 1993 the church has been used as an exhibition space for international concrete art, i.e. art which places a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. It has nothing to do with concrete, the buidling material.\n\nThe Defense Barracks, by far the largest building on Petersberg Citadel, was built from 1828 to\n1831 by the Prussian administration, on the site of former monastery building which had been\ndamage by fire in 1813 and later demolished.\n\nThe building is 167 metres long and 18.8 metres wide. The external walls are up to 2 metres\nthick. It could accommodate approximately 500 soldiers and was built primarily as an artillery\nposition to hinder enemy access to the upper plateau of the citadel from the north.\nAfter the unification of Germany in 1871, the building was mainly used for housing soldiers and\nfor storage. In 1912-1913 it was remodelled and expanded with a neo-Baroque style mansard roof and the addition of large dormer windows on both sides of the building. After this it was then able to accommodate 750 soldiers.\n\nAfter the end of World War I in 1918, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was gradual decline in use of military facilities in Germany. The barracks was used as residential building and as quarters for the civil police and the Freikorps Th\u00fcringen, a civilian militia army unit.\n\nDuring the rearmament of the army during the Nazi period, there was renewed military use\nof Petersberg citadel. From 1936 to 1938 part of the barracks was used to house the new\nestablished Motorized Infantry Regiment no. 71, and from 1938 to 1939 as the headquaters of\nthe army's administrative offices. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people was established\nin the Defense Barracks, and this was continued by the occupying Soviet administration after the\nwar.\n\nWhen the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949, the citadel again\nwas used by the military. The Defense Barracks was used to accommodate a police school, the\nKasernierte Volkspolizei (a precusor to the Nationale Volksarmee - NVA), and after 1956 newly formed NVA. After 1963 the citadel became the property of the city of Erfurt and the Defense Barracks were used for storage.

Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860's and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s.\n\nEven though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt-water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal. \n\nBecause of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920's, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.", "id": 77}, {"title": "Truth_is_Beauty", "content": "Truth is Beauty\n\nTruth is Beauty, is a sculpture by Marco Cochrane.

Originally trained in Ireland, he was a top-class performer as a juvenile in 1998 when he finished second in both the Tyros Stakes and the Futurity Stakes before recording his bigget win in the Group 1 National Stakes. After failing to win as a three-year-old he was sent to the United States and gelded. Returning to the track in 2001 he made little impact in two starts but did much better in the following year when he won five races including the Henry S. Clark Stakes and C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes.\n\nMus-If was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Eurostrait Ltd. As a yearling he was consigned to the sales at Deauville in August 1997 and was bought for \u20a3350,000 by Hamdan Al-Maktoum's Shadwell Estate company. The colt was sent to Ireland and entered training with Dermot Weld.\n\nHe was one of the best horses sired by Lahib who won the Queen Anne Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. Lahib's other progeny included Super Tassa, Vicious Circle (Ebor Handicap), Last Resort (Challenge Stakes) and Late Night Out (Supreme Stakes). Mus-If's dam Navajo Love Song showed little racing ability, failing to win in seven starts. She was, however, a descendant of the French broodmare Moira (foaled 1959) who was the female-line ancestor of Dancing Maid.\n\nMus-If made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 18 June in which he started at odds of 7/2 and finished second by a neck to Fable after leading for most of the way. Eighteen days late he recorded his first success in a maiden over seven furlongs at the Curragh. Ridden by Mick Kinane and starting the 6/4 favourite, he took the lead three furlongs out and kept on well in the closing stages to win by a head from Globe Theatre. The colt was moved up in class for the Listed Tyros Stakes over the same course and distance on 15 August for which he started favourite but was beaten into second place by the Jim Bolger-trained filly Arctic Blue. He found another Bolger filly, St Clair Ridge, too good for him in the Group 3 Futurity Stakes two weeks later and was beaten a length and a half into second place.\n\nIn the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 20 September Mus-If, with Kinane in the saddle started the 8/1 third choice in the betting behind the Acomb Stakes runner-up Coliseum and Globe Theatre. None of the other six runners had contested a Group race, making the field appear to be a poor one by Group 1 standards. The best horse in the race was probably the British-trained Royal Rebel, who later won two editions of the Ascot Gold Cup. Wearing blinkers, Mus-If went to the front from the start, opened up a clear advantage approaching the last quarter mile and held off the late challenge of Coliseum to win by a neck.\n\nMus-if began his second season in the Listed 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown on 18 April. He took the lead in the straight but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a head by the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Saffron Walden. In the Irish 2000 Guineas five week later at the Curragh he went to the front two furlongs out but was overtaken entering the final furlong and came home fourth behind Saffron Walden, Enrique and Orpen with the 2000 Guineas winner Island Sands in fifth. The colt was the dropped in class for the International Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh in June but finished last of the five runners behind the Henry Cecil-tranied favourite Great Dane. On his final European start, Mus-If was sent to Germany to contest the Group 2 Grosse Europcar-Meile at Cologne-Weidenpesch Racecourse on 25 September. He was made the 3/5 favourite but came home fourth behind the four-year-old El Divino.\n\nAt the end of his European racing career Mus-If was sent to the United States where he was \"mistakenly\" gelded. He re-entered training in 2001 and joined the stable of Neil Drysdale in California. He raced twice at Santa Anita Park, finishing second in a claiming race in February and fourth in a similar event in March.\n\nIn 2002 Mus-If moved to the training stable of Michael Pino and began his campaign in claiming races at Fair Grounds Race Course. After finishing fourth and third on his first two starts he recorded his first success for three and a half years whe taking a claimer on 11 March. After winning a similar event at Keeneland Racecourse in April he was stepped up in class to contest the Henry S. Clark Stakes over one mile at Pimlico Race Course on 4 May. Starting favourite against ten opponents he took the lead in the stretch and won by five lengths under a \"hand ride\" from his trainer's brother Mario Pino. Three weeks later at the same track, Mus-If extended his winning sequence to four in the C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes. With Mario Pino again in the saddle he started at long odds-on and came home two lengths clear of Cynics Beware after taking the lead on the home turn. His victory was only confirmed after a lengthy inquiry by the racecourse stewards into possible interference caused by Mus-If to one of his rivals on the far turn. The gelding's winning streak came to an end in June when he was beaten into second place by Del Mar Show in the Grade III New Hampshire Sweepstakes Handicap at Rockingham Park.\n\nIn the late summer and autumn of 2002 Mus-If was campaigned at Delaware Park Racetrack where he finished sixth in the Susex Handicap and third in the Leader of the Band Stakes before winning a claiming race on 6 October. On his last two starts he finihed second in a claiming race at Churchill Downs in November and seventh in a similar event at Fair Grounds on 8 December.", "id": 84}, {"title": "The_Army_of_a_Dream", "content": "The Army of a Dream\n\nThe Army of a Dream is a speculative fiction short story written by Rudyard Kipling, published in the Morning Post in June 1904. It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Military was at that time.\n\nUsing indirect exposition, Kipling conveys to the reader that the narrator is experiencing the story as a dream. The story itself involves a military man taking the narrator around and showing off his military unit, the \"Tynesiders\". It is revealed that in their society, military service is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. Unlike military forces common through much of history, those of the story are not authoritarian or what one might otherwise call \"militaristic\", but are a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation.\n\nRudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is in fact the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since.
